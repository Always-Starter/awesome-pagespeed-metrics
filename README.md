## üë´ user-centric metrics

the idea from [Leveraging the Performance Metrics that Most Affect User Experience](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/user-centric-performance-metrics) by @philipwalton / Google

üîú is it happening?

ü§î is it meaningful?

üëÜ is it usable?

ü•É is it smooth?

use these to organize/prioritize your metrics
